# Neovim-config

This is a simple init.vim file, that can be used as a starting point in any neovim setup.



## Installation process

For this setup to work, you first need to make sure to have vim-plug installed. 
Vim-plug's source code and installation process can be found [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Now, all you need to do is create a folder in ~/.config named nvim.

The path to the folder will then be:

```
~/.config/nvim
```

In this folder, create a file named **init.vim**

Then, simply paste the contents of **config.txt** into the file, write and quit, and run neovim again.

Run :PlugInstall in order to download the plugins, quit neovim and open it again for the changes to apply.
